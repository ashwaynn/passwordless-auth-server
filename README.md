# Passworless Auth Server

* The project is in *development stage*.
* It contains a very simple server written using `Node.js`. 
* For now, the server runs on *port 3000* and handles two `GET` requests (*/sign-in* and */welcome*) and one `POST request (*/sign-in*).
* This repo also contains a `SQL` script that creates a ***users*** table in the schema `passwordless_auth` (Drops the schema if it already exists and creates it again).
